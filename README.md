# Word Embedding Using Neural Network

## Overview
This project implements a word embedding model using a neural network. Word embeddings are vector representations of words that capture semantic relationships. This model learns word embeddings through a neural network trained on a given text corpus.

## Features
- Custom word embedding using neural networks
- Implements Skip-gram / CBOW models (if applicable)
- Uses PyTorch/TensorFlow/Keras (mention which framework is used)
- Trains embeddings on a given dataset
- Visualizes word relationships using dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE)

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/word-embedding-nn.git
cd word-embedding-nn

# Install dependencies (modify based on the framework used)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Prepare the training dataset (corpus of text).
2. Preprocess the text (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
3. Train the neural network to generate word embeddings.
4. Save and visualize the embeddings.

Run the training script:
```sh
python train.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 64 --learning_rate 0.01
```

## Model Architecture
- Input Layer: Word indices
- Embedding Layer: Dense representation of words
- Hidden Layers: Fully connected layers (if applicable)
- Output Layer: Predicts target words in context (for Skip-gram/CBOW)

## Visualization
Once training is complete, embeddings can be visualized using t-SNE or PCA:
```sh
python visualize.py
```

## Dataset
- The model can be trained on standard datasets like Wikipedia, Common Crawl, or custom corpora.
- Preprocessing includes tokenization, removing special characters, and lowercasing text.

## Results
- Displays nearest neighbors of words.
- Evaluates similarity between words.
- Generates a 2D visualization of word vectors.
